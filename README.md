Instructions
1. Install the latest version of Webots from https://cyberbotics.com/#download
2. Download the project from this GitHub repository ( https://github.com/bryhig/tse-g1/ ) as a .zip folder by clicking the green download code button. It can also be downloaded from the releases section of this repository.
3. Once downloaded, extract this .zip folder.
4. Enter the extracted file, and enter the folder named 'Project'.
5. Once in this file there should be two folders, one named 'Our implementation' and one named 'Replication of existing implementation'. Choose which one you would like to view (or both at the same time to compare the two). These essentially contain identical cod and simulation files, with the exception of the obstacle avoidance algorithm the robot uses.
6. Enter the chosen folder, then enter the folder named 'worlds'. Once in the 'worlds' folder open the file named 'tse.wbt'.
7. When this file is opened, it will open Webots and load into the simulation we have created. If the webots 'play' button doesnt automatically start itself, please click it. Once playing, you will be able to see our robot running our source code, and the supervisor controller removing the dust texture.
