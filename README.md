Team Software Engineering - Robotics G1 project
Last Updated: 02/03/2021

A software engineering project to create an efficient obstacle avoidance algorithm robot controller for the iRobot Create using the open-source Webots Robotics simulator.

Current progress:
- All robot hardware (motors and sensors) have been initialized and configured.
- Obstacle detection code using the information obtained from these sensors has been written.

Multiple identical commits on 02/03/2021 were due to bad internet connection. They were not showing on GitHub, despite being commited.
