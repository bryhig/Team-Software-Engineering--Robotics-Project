Team Software Engineering - Robotics G1 project
Last Updated: 17/03/2021

A software engineering project to create an efficient obstacle avoidance algorithm('s) robot controller, in C++, for the iRobot Create. We are using the open-source Webots Robotics simulator to do this.

To run this controller you must have a C++ compiler, as well as the latest version of Webots Robotics Simulator installed.

Current progress:
- All robot hardware (motors and sensors) have been initialized and configured.
- Obstacle detection code using the information obtained from these sensors has been written.
- A basic obstacle avoidance algorithm has been implemented.
- Robot has full functionality to move around a space cleaning.

Coming up:
- More efficient implementations of obstacle avoidance algorithms so the robot can clean a room to an optimal extent.

Multiple identical commits on 02/03/2021 were due to bad internet connection.
